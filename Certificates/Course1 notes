SQL is the native language for working with data from database 
SQL server is relational database developed by microsoft 
T-SQL is SQL implementation of sql server 
write the keywords in upper case and the columns in lowercase make the query is easier to read 
Amend your query to return : add new column to the query 
Alias : You can use AS within queries to rename columns and tables, and to provide an alias for the table results.
the query return specific set of data , and set has no order 
When filtering strings, you need to wrap your value in 'single quotes
Using variables makes it easy to run a query multiple times, with different values, without having to scroll down and amend the WHERE clause each time. You can quickly update the variable at the top of the query instead. This also helps provide greater security, but that is out of scope of this course.
Sometimes you might want to 'save' the results of a query so you can do some more work with the data. You can do that by creating a temporary table that remains in the database until SQL Server is restarted.


Working with NULL values
A NULL value could mean 'zero' - if something doesn't happen, it can't be logged in a table. However, NULL can also mean 'unknown' or 'missing'. So consider if it is appropriate to replace them in your results. NULL values provide feedback on data quality. If you have NULL values, and you didn't expect to have any, then you have an issue with either how data is captured or how it's entered in the database.
